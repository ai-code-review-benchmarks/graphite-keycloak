= Role members including groups

The Admin REST API endpoints `GET /{realm}/roles/{role-name}/users` and `GET /{realm}/clients/{client-id}/roles/{role-name}/users`
now support the query parameter `includeGroups`.

When `includeGroups=true`, the response contains not only users directly assigned the role
but also users that inherit the role from a group or any of its sub-groups. Pagination is applied
after combining direct and group-derived users to avoid duplicate entries.
