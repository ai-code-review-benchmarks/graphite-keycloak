== Preface

In some sample listings, the intended content for one line exceeds the available page width. These lines have been broken up. A '\' at the end of a line means that a break is introduced to fit in the page, with the following lines indented.  For example:

[source]
----
Let's pretend to have an extremely \
  long line that \
  does not fit
This one is short
----         
Is really: 

[source]
----
Let's pretend to have an extremely long line that does not fit
This one is short
----
