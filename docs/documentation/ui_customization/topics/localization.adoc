== Internationalization and Localization

Keycloak supports localized text throughout all user interfaces.

.Prerequisites

* To enable internationalization for a realm, you must enable internationalization in the `Realm settings` section of the admin console. See the {adminguide_link}[{adminguide_name}].

=== Localizing mesages in a theme

Text in the templates is loaded from message bundles. A theme that extends another theme will inherit all messages from the parent's message bundle and you can
override individual messages by adding `<THEME TYPE>/messages/messages_en.properties` to your theme.

For example to replace `Username` on the login form with `Your Username` for the `mytheme` create the file
`themes/mytheme/login/messages/messages_en.properties` with the following content:

[source]
----
usernameOrEmail=Your Username
----

Within a message values like `{0}` and `{1}` are replaced with arguments when the message is used. For example {0} in `Log in to {0}` is replaced with the name
of the realm.

Texts of these message bundles can be overwritten by realm-specific values. The realm-specific values are manageable via UI and API.

=== Adding a language to a theme



.Procedure

. Create the file `<THEME TYPE>/messages/messages_<LOCALE>.properties` in the directory of your theme.

. Add this file to the `locales` property in `<THEME TYPE>/theme.properties`.
For a language to be available to users the realms `login`, `account` and `email`, the theme has to support the language, so you need to add your language for those theme types.
+
For example, to add Norwegian translations to the `mytheme` theme create the file `themes/mytheme/login/messages/messages_no.properties` with the
following content:
+
[source]
----
usernameOrEmail=Brukernavn
password=Passord
----
+
If you omit a translation for messages, they will use English.

. Edit `themes/mytheme/login/theme.properties` and add:
+
[source]
----
locales=en,no
----

. Add the same for the `account` and `email` theme types. To do this create `themes/mytheme/account/messages/messages_no.properties` and
`themes/mytheme/email/messages/messages_no.properties`. Leaving these files empty will result in the English messages being used.

. Copy `themes/mytheme/login/theme.properties` to `themes/mytheme/account/theme.properties` and `themes/mytheme/email/theme.properties`.

. Add a translation for the language selector. This is done by adding a message to the English translation. To do this add the following to
`themes/mytheme/account/messages/messages_en.properties` and `themes/mytheme/login/messages/messages_en.properties`:
+
[source]
----
locale_no=Norsk
----

By default, message properties files should be encoded using UTF-8.
Keycloak falls back to ISO-8859-1 handling if it can't read the contents as UTF-8.
Unicode characters can be escaped as described in Java's documentation for https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/PropertyResourceBundle.html[PropertyResourceBundle].
Previous versions of Keycloak supported specifying the encoding in the first line with a comment like `# encoding: UTF-8`, which is no longer supported.

* See <<_locale_selector,Locale Selector>> for details on how the current locale is selected.

=== Overriding localized text for an entire realm

Often, you wish to declare translations that take effect for an entire realm.  This is done by specifying key/value pairs in the realm settings.
