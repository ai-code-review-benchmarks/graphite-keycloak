== Introduction

{project_name} includes user interfaces (UIs) for login, Admin Console, and Account Console.  It also has a "welcome" screen used for initial setup.

You can customize, extend, and modify these UIs to accommodate many use cases on your production systems.  At a minimum, you will need to change logos and colors to match your corporate identity.  Also, you may modify the UIs to implement new functionality.

This guide provides all the information needed to customize the {project_name} UIs for your needs.
