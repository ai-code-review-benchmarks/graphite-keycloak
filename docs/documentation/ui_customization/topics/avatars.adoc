== Using Avatars

Both the admin and account consoles allow use of an avatar to personalize the user experience.  {project_name} supports avatars using the oidc standard `picture` claim.

This `picture` claim should have a URI as its value.  The URI should point to the avatar meant to be displayed in the masthead section of the admin console or account console.

=== Setting a picture attribute from the admin console
The simplest way to allow users to specify the avatar URI is to add a `picture` attribute in User profile.  Just go to the admin console and navigate to the `Realm Settings -> User profile` tab.

Here is an example setup of the `picture` attribute:

=== Avatar success
Here is the result in account console once the URI is saved for the picture attribute:

=== Important warning
CAUTION: Allowing users to specify their own URI could lead to security concerns.  An avatar can contain malware so it is important that images come from a trusted source.  One way to accomplish this is to make sure that the `picture` has a regular expression validator to restrict the URI.
