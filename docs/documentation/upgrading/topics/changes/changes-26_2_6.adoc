== Notable changes

Notable changes where an internal behavior changed to prevent common misconfigurations, fix bugs or simplify running {project_name}.

=== Upgrade procedure changed for the distribution

If you are upgrading {project_name} by downloading the distribution, the upgrade procedure has been changed. Previously it recommended copying over the contents from the `conf/` folder from the old to the new installation.
The new procedure recommends to re-apply any changes to `cache-ispn.xml` or a custom cache configuration based on the file included in the new version.

This prevents accidentally downgrading functionality, for example, by using an old `cache-ispn.xml` file from a previous version.

=== Volatile Session Cache Defaults

If the `persistent-user-sessions` feature is disabled, i.e. volatile sessions are configured, {project_name} now prevents
`num_owners=1` being configured unless a shared persistent store is also configured. This is to prevent data loss on cache
rebalances.
