=== Managing organization roles

[role="_abstract"]
Organization roles provide fine-grained access control within organizations. You can create, assign, and manage roles specific to each organization to control member permissions and access levels.

Organization roles are created and managed separately for each organization. Each role has a name and optional description.

.Procedure

. Click *Organizations* in the menu.
. Select the organization where you want to create a role.
. Click the *Roles* tab.
. Click *Create role*.
. Enter a *Role name*. The role name must be unique within the organization.
. Optionally, enter a *Description* for the role.
. Click *Save*.

The new role appears in the roles list for the organization.

==== Assigning organization roles to members

After creating organization roles, you can assign them to organization members to control their access and permissions.

You can remove role assignments from organization members when they no longer need specific permissions.

. In the *Organization roles* section, select the roles you want to remove from the *Assigned roles* list.

When an organization role is no longer needed, you can delete it. Deleting a role automatically removes all assignments of that role from organization members.

. Select the organization.
. Click the *Roles* tab.
. Click the *Actions* menu (â‹®) for the role you want to delete.

==== Using organization roles in authorization policies

Organization roles can be used in authorization policies to control access to resources based on organization membership and assigned roles.

.Procedure

. Configure authorization for your client as described in the link:{authzguide_link}[Authorization Services Guide].
. Create a new policy of type *Organization Role*.
. Select the target organization and required roles.
. Configure the policy logic (Positive or Negative).
. Save the policy and associate it with permissions and resources as needed.

This allows you to create fine-grained access control based on organization membership and role assignments.
