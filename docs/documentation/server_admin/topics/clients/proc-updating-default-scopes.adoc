[role="_abstract"]
Use *Realm Default Client Scopes* to define sets of client scopes that are automatically linked to newly created clients.

To see the realm default client scopes, click the *Client Scopes* tab on the left part of the admin console. In the column *Assigned type* you can specify if particular client scope should be added as
*Default Client Scope* or *Optional Client Scope* to newly created clients. See <<_client_scopes_linking, this section>> for the details on what are _default_ and _optional_ client scopes.

When a client is created, you can unlink the default client scopes, if needed. This is similar to removing <<_default_roles, Default Roles>>.
