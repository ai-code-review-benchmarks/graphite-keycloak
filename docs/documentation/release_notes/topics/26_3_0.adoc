= Usage of remote stores for embedded caches is restricted

Previously, usage of remote stores was discouraged and the experimental feature `cache-embedded-remote-store` needed to be enabled to run in this setup.
In this release, the experimental feature was removed and usage of remote stores was restricted.
If you previously used the `cache-embedded-remote-store` feature, see the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for migration steps.
