// See https://www.cloudping.co/ for an overview of AWS latencies between AZs

A P50 round-trip latency of less than 5 ms is suggested and below 10 ms is strongly recommended, together with a full ownership of the network between the zones.

Network latency and latency spikes amplify in the response time of the service and can lead to queued requests, timeouts, and failed requests.
This can trigger downtimes until the failure detection isolates problematic nodes.
